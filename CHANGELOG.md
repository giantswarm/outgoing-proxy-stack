## [0.15.0] - 2024-07-05

With this version, `cluster-aws` will take over reconciliation of all the default apps.

## [0.14.0] - 2024-07-05

### Changed

This is an intermediate release in the `cluster-aws` [`v0.76.0` upgrade process](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-aws/releases/tag/v0.76.0).

:warning: IMPORTANT: :warning: first apply version `0.13.0` of this chart and set `apps.deleteOptions.moveAppsHelmOwnershipToClusterAws` value to `true`, before upgrading to `0.14.0`.

This release will:

- Delete the `default-apps-aws` App CR
- Migrate the cilium app config to the `cluster-aws` configuration

After you've applied this version and the `default-apps-aws` has been removed, upgrade to the next release so `cluster-aws` takes over the default apps.

### Changed

In preparation to upgrade `cluster-aws` to [`v0.76.0`](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-aws/releases/tag/v0.76.0):

- Upgrade `default-apps-aws` to `0.52.0`
- Upgrade `cluster-aws` to `0.75.0`
- Add `apps.deleteOptions.moveAppsHelmOwnershipToClusterAws` value (defaults to `false`) to be able to migrate default apps to `cluster-aws`. Set this to `true` before upgrading to the next version of this app.
